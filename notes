Pedro,

I know you have your hands quite busy,but its just a idea to explore,i noticed that with the old mydvdtrader,the movie recommendations really sucked,it would be great to feature better ones rather than the generic ones it had.

The movie recommendations were not autogenerated but manually executed by me and users,would be nice to have a API service autogenerate that for a change.

So,i did some research and stumbled upon some great free api services,you may want to explore:

These are the URL from the Jmovies component, for trades in and trades out. Those are the codes I need to study:
index.php?option=com_jmovies&Itemid=28&task=tradesin
index.php?option=com_jmovies&Itemid=28&task=tradesout
index.php?option=com_jmovies&amp;task=posteditems

There is also a trailer component that can be salvaged.
We need a Wish List too. A Rent Item option as well.
