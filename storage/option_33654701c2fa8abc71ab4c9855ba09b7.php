Battle scenes are intercut with footage of three of the soldiers - played by Ryan Phillipe, Jesse Bradford, and Adam Beach -- who survived the battle going on a goodwill tour of the United States in order to sell war bonds. Many evening they are forced to reenact their famous pose, something each of them finds more and more difficult to do as they suffer from survivor\'s guilt. Eastwood frames the story by having one of the men\'s grown son (Tom McCarthy) interview his father\'s old comrades in order to find out more about what happened to his father. Eastwood followed this film with Letters from Iwo Jima, a second film about the battle of Iwo Jima, but told from the Japanese perspective. Flags of Our Fathers was produced by Eastwood and Steven Spielberg. ~ Perry Seibert, All Movie Guide";s:10:"date_added";s:1:"0";s:8:"modified";s:19:"0000-00-00 00:00:00";s:11:"modified_by";s:1:"0";s:5:"image";s:170:"a:2:{s:5:"image";s:59:"directcron/img_pictures/flags_of_our_fathers 2 16.12.07.jpg";s:9:"thumbnail";s:61:"directcron/img_thumbnails/flags_of_our_fathers 2 16.12.07.jpg";}";s:5:"video";N;s:8:"item_url";s:0:"";s:12:"templatefile";s:7:"oneitem";s:8:"metadesc";s:0:"";s:8:"meta_key";s:0:"";s:10:"searchkeys";s:0:"";s:6:"visits";s:3:"644";s:9:"published";s:1:"1";s:8:"ordering";s:1:"0";s:8:"featured";s:1:"0";s:14:"featured_order";s:1:"0";s:6:"access";s:6:"public";s:12:"published_up";s:19:"2007-12-27 23:54:33";s:14:"published_down";N;}i:1;O:8:"stdClass":23:{s:2:"id";s:2:"61";s:8:"category";s:2:"13";s:4:"item";s:12:"Spider-Man 3";s:12:"item_creator";s:1:"0";s:11:"description";s:2004:"Your friendly neighborhood web-slinger is back, only this time his sunny outlook has become partially overcast in the third chapter of director Sam Raimi\'s Spider-Man saga. Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, and James Franco return to reprise their roles from the previous two installments, with Thomas Haden Church, Topher Grace, and Bryce Dallas Howard making their first appearances in the series as Flint Marko (aka Sandman), Eddie Brock (aka Venom), and Gwen Stacy, respectively. Peter Parker (Maguire) has finally leaned to walk the middle ground between being the superhero that his city needs, and the man that Mary Jane (Dunst) loves. All is well in New York City until one night, as Peter and M.J. set gazing at the stars, a falling comet streams across the sky and crashes into the ground close by. But this isn\'t any ordinary shooting star, and upon impact the mysterious space rock is split open to reveal a shape-shifting symbiote with the power to overtake anything that it comes into contact with. Later, as Harry Osborn acquires his late father\'s flying board, engineers a powerful new Goblin outfit, and takes to the sky to avenge dad\'s death, the mysterious space sludge infects both Peter\'s Spider Man suit and ambitious street photographer Eddie Brock (Grace). His strange new suit giving him a newfound sense of power as it gradually overpowers his personality, Peter discovers that escaped convict Flint Marko was in fact the man responsible for the death of Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson). Unfortunately for Peter, Marko has recently acquired the power to morph at will and quickly completes his transformation into the dreaded Sandman. As the Sandman gives in to his darkest criminal instincts and the slithering space symbiote transforms Eddie Brock into the nightmarish fanged villain known as Venom, the citizens of New York City must once again call on Spider Man to fend off destructive forces that are far too powerful for the likes of mortal man. ~ Jason Buchanan, All Movie Guide";s:10:"date_added";s:1:"0";s:8:"modified";s:19:"2008-04-17 00:35:19";s:11:"modified_by";s:2:"62";s:5:"image";s:148:"a:2:{s:5:"image";s:48:"directcron/img_pictures/spider-man3_plakat1d.jpg";s:9:"thumbnail";s:50:"directcron/img_thumbnails/spider-man3_plakat1d.jpg";}";s:5:"video";N;s:8:"item_url";s:0:"";s:12:"templatefile";s:7:"oneitem";s:8:"metadesc";s:0:"";s:8:"meta_key";s:0:"";s:10:"searchkeys";s:0:"";s:6:"visits";s:3:"851";s:9:"published";s:1:"1";s:8:"ordering";s:1:"0";s:8:"featured";s:1:"0";s:14:"featured_order";s:1:"0";s:6:"access";s:6:"public";s:12:"published_up";s:19:"2007-12-27 23:49:43";s:14:"published_down";N;}i:2;O:8:"stdClass":23:{s:2:"id";s:2:"60";s:8:"category";s:2:"18";s:4:"item";s:8:"The Omen";s:12:"item_creator";s:1:"0";s:11:"description";s:2362:"Many believe the prophecy from the Book of Revelation provides a map to a terrifying future?or it presents fragments of history that have come to life in our time.

Thorn, a senior American diplomat, has other things on his mind. His wife, Katherine, has endured a difficult delivery and she?s as yet unaware their newborn child has died.

Sadie Blake (Lucy Liu) is a journalist who becomes acquainted with a group of beautiful but doomstruck partiers while following a story, led by the charismatic Bishop (James D\'Arcy). While Sadie is taken with Bishop\'s good looks and sinister charm, she senses there\'s something dangerous about him, but it\'s not until she wakes up in the city morgue that she learns his secret -- Bishop is a vampire, and Sadie has joined his underlings as one of the undead. Angry and betrayed, Sadie is determined to stop Bishop and his compatriots, and she prowls the city with bow and arrow, ready to stake them from a distance when she spies them. Sadie finds an unlikely ally in her crusade in Detective Rawlins (Michael Chiklis), a police investigator whose daughter was transformed into a night creature by Bishop. However, Sadie is finding it increasingly difficult to resist her growing thirst for the blood of the living, becoming the sort of being she has grown to hate.

There was a time when no one noticed reserved driver Frank Lucas (Washington), but when the criminal kingpin he was charged with transporting through the city streets suddenly dies, Lucas seizes the opportunity to build his own criminal empire. In the following months, Lucas solidifies his status as Harlem\'s most innovative drug dealer by delivering a product that is purer than the competitors\' and cheaper, as well. When innovative businessman Lukas attempts to go semi-legit by becoming one of the Manhattan borough\'s biggest civil supporters, however, street-savvy outcast cop Ritchie Roberts (Russell Crowe) begins to sense a sizable shift in the hierarchy of the drug underworld. But Roberts is one of the few honest detectives operating within a corrupt system, and as he sets out to investigate the case, crooked detective Trupo (Josh Brolin) does everything in his power to compromise the integrity of his idealistic counterpart. Upon clearing all of the usual Mafia-connected suspects, Roberts begins to believe that a previously unknown black power player has come out of the woodwork to dominate the local drug trade. While Roberts and Lucas may be operating on opposite sides of the law, the one thing that both men have in common is a strict code of ethics that separates them from their opportunistic colleagues. Now, as a confrontation between the two men becomes inevitable and the fate of each becomes inexorably tied to the other, it gradually becomes apparent that only one of them will emerge from the conflict victorious. ~ Jason Buchanan, All Movie Guide";s:8:"meta_key";s:25:"Drama, American Gangster ";s:10:"searchkeys";s:44:"Denzel Washington,Russell Crowe,Ridley Scott";s:6:"visits";s:3:"413";s:9:"published";s:1:"1";s:8:"ordering";s:1:"0";s:8:"featured";s:1:"0";s:14:"featured_order";s:1:"0";s:6:"access";s:6:"public";s:12:"published_up";s:19:"2007-12-25 23:44:23";s:14:"published_down";N;}i:17;O:8:"stdClass":23:{s:2:"id";s:2:"45";s:8:"category";s:2:"13";s:4:"item";s:12:"Transformers";s:12:"item_creator";s:1:"0";s:11:"description";s:1506:"Based on the Hasbro toy line that initially captivated kids in the 1980s, director Michael Bay?s TRANSFORMERS finds two warring bands of shape-shifting alien robots renewing their intergalactic conflict on Earth.

An Inconvenient Truth records a multi-media presentation hosted by Gore in which he discusses the scientific facts behind global warming, explains how it has already begun to affect our environment, talks about the disastrous consequences if the world\'s governments and citizens do not act, and shares what each individual can do to help protect the Earth for this and future generations.
