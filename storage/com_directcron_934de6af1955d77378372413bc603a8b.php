Their adaptation of McCarthy\'s praised novel is a staggering masterpiece. In this almost impossibly faithful adaptation, the film takes place in a small Texas border town in 1980. Sheriff Bell (a never-been-better Tommy Lee Jones) has ruled the land for years without the use of a gun, but a new brand of reckless lawlessness has taken over his town. Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) is an innocent Everyman with a devoted wife, Carla Jean (Kelly Macdonald), but when he stumbles across a drug deal gone deadly and finds two million dollars, he\'s determined to keep it for himself. There\'s only one problem. He\'s being pursued by one of the most amoral, evil psychopaths that the big screen has ever seen. Wearing an absurd haircut and brandishing a pressurized weapon that\'s used to murder cattle, Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) creeps forward on his mission to track Moss down and return the money to its rightful owners to save his own skin. As the tension mounts, the body count begins to rise, confirming Sheriff Bell\'s inability to battle this new wave of modern brutality. The most striking thing about the Coen Brothers\' thriller is their masterly use of silence to create an almost unbearable level of tension. Cinematographer Roger Deakins is once again at the top of his game, beautifully capturing this stark and lonely world. The well-rounded cast is clearly excited to be a part of such a stellar production--particularly Bardem, whose Chigurh is a freakishly mysterious monster, and is certain to haunt viewers long after the final credit has rolled.

Saw IV also offers a class reunion of characters from the previous three films, each once again up to their necks in Jigsaw\'s schemes. Chief among them is Sgt. Rigg (Lyriq Bent) from Saw II, who must place himself in Jigsaw\'s shoes in order to rescue Detective Matthews (Donnie Walhberg), who was abducted by the killer at the end of Saw II, and Forensic Hoffman (Costas Mandylor from Saw III), from another elaborate murder device. Meanwhile, FBI agents led by Scott Patterson (Gilmore Girls, Aliens in America) attempt to track Rigg as he carries out Jigsaw\'s horrific notion of justice from beyond the grave.

Homeland Security meanwhile wants to recruit Jim for some special ops in Central America, but first he has to pass a urine test. This is the directorial debut of David Ayer, who wrote TRAINING DAY, which this film resembles with its smog-saturated cinematography and loving attention to the minutiae of male bonding and "homey codes" in and around L.A.\'s inner-city drug culture. One never knows where the story is going, or what\'s around the next corner in this off-center yarn, and Ayer captures that uneasy feeling of cruising through a bad part of town in a car with someone who you slowly realize cannot be trusted.

Based on the Ian Fleming novel that introduced Agent 007 into a Cold War world, Casino Royale is the most brutal and viscerally exciting James Bond film since Sean Connery left Her Majesty\'s Secret Service. Meet the new Bond; not the same as the old Bond. Daniel Craig gives a galvanizing performance as the freshly minted double-0 agent. Suave, yes, but also a "blunt instrument," reckless, and possessed with an ego that compromises his judgment during his first mission to root out the mastermind behind an operation that funds international terrorists. In classic Bond film tradition, his global itinerary takes him to far-flung locales, including Uganda, Madagascar, the Bahamas (that\'s more like it), and Montenegro, where he is pitted against his nemesis in a poker game, with hundreds of millions in the pot. The stakes get even higher when Bond lets down his "armor" and falls in love with Vesper (Eva Green), the ravishing banker\'s representative fronting him the money.";s:10:"date_added";s:1:"0";s:8:"modified";s:19:"2008-02-16 16:24:47";s:11:"modified_by";s:2:"62";s:5:"image";s:130:"a:2:{s:5:"image";s:39:"directcron/img_pictures/21vey5z82rl.jpg";s:9:"thumbnail";s:41:"directcron/img_thumbnails/21vey5z82rl.jpg";}";s:5:"video";N;s:8:"item_url";s:0:"";s:12:"templatefile";s:7:"oneitem";s:8:"metadesc";s:0:"";s:8:"meta_key";s:0:"";s:10:"searchkeys";s:0:"";s:6:"visits";s:4:"2950";s:9:"published";s:1:"1";s:8:"ordering";s:1:"0";s:8:"featured";s:1:"0";s:14:"featured_order";s:1:"0";s:6:"access";s:6:"public";s:12:"published_up";s:19:"2007-12-28 00:17:45";s:14:"published_down";N;}i:19;O:8:"stdClass":23:{s:2:"id";s:2:"64";s:8:"category";s:2:"22";s:4:"item";s:21:"Letters From Iwo Jima";s:12:"item_creator";s:1:"0";s:11:"description";s:2087:"After bringing the story of the American soldiers who fought in the battle of Iwo Jima to the screen in his film Flags of Our Fathers, Clint Eastwood offers an equally thoughtful portrait of the Japanese forces who held the island for 36 days in this military drama. In 1945, World War II was in its last stages, and U.S. forces were planning to take on the Japanese on a small island known as Iwo Jima. While the island was mostly rock and volcanoes, it was of key strategic value and Japan\'s leaders saw the island as the final opportunity to prevent an Allied invasion. Lt. General Tadamichi Kuribayashi (Ken Watanabe) was put in charge of the forces on Iwo Jima; Kuribayashi had spent time in the United States and was not eager to take on the American army, but he also understood his opponents in a way his superiors did not, and devised an unusual strategy of digging tunnels and deep foxholes that allowed his troops a tactical advantage over the invading soldiers. While Kuribayashi\'s strategy alienated some older officers, it impressed Baron Nishi (Tsuyoshi Ihara), the son of a wealthy family who had also studied America firsthand as an athlete at the 1932 Olympics. As Kuribayashi and his men dig in for a battle they are not certain they can win -- and most have been told they will not survive -- their story is told both by watching their actions and through the letters they write home to their loved ones, letters that in many cases would not be delivered until long after they were dead. Among the soldiers manning Japan\'s last line of defense are Saigo (Kazunari Ninomiya), a baker sent to Iwo Jima only days before his wife was to give birth; Shimizu (Ryo Kase), who was sent to Iwo Jima after washing out in the military police; and Lieutenant Ito (Shidou Nakamura), who has embraced the notion of "Death Before Surrender" with particular ferocity. Filmed in Japanese with a primarily Japanese cast, Letters From Iwo Jima was shot in tandem with Flags of Our Fathers, and the two films were released within two months of one another. ~ Mark Deming, All Movie Guide";s:10:"date_added";s:1:"0";s:8:"modified";s:19:"2008-02-13 14:36:49";s:11:"modified_by";s:2:"62";s:5:"image";s:156:"a:2:{s:5:"image";s:52:"directcron/img_pictures/lettersfromiwojimaposter.jpg";s:9:"thumbnail";s:54:"directcron/img_thumbnails/lettersfromiwojimaposter.jpg";}";s:5:"video";N;s:8:"item_url";s:0:"";s:12:"templatefile";s:7:"oneitem";s:8:"metadesc";s:2094:"War, After bringing the story of the American soldiers who fought in the battle of Iwo Jima to the screen in his film Flags of Our Fathers, Clint Eastwood offers an equally thoughtful portrait of the Japanese forces who held the island for 36 days in this military drama.
